"""Loading and lookup of the local device registry.

The registry is whatever the tinytuya wizard wrote out. Two shapes exist in the
wild and both are accepted:

    devices.json  -> [ {...}, {...} ]
    snapshot.json -> { "timestamp": ..., "devices": [ {...}, {...} ] }

Field names differ slightly between them ("version" vs "ver", "ip" vs
"address"), so everything is normalised into a DeviceRecord on load.
